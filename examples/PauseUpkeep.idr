module Main

-- Copyright 2026, Hattori,Hiroki. All rights reserved.
-- This module was licensed by BSD3.

-- Exercises curl_easy_pause/curl_easy_upkeep -- both plain input-only
-- bindings, fully bound on all three backends.
--
-- curl_easy_pause(3) is only meaningful called from inside a transfer
-- callback (e.g. CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION returning
-- CURL_WRITEFUNC_PAUSE) -- without one (see TODO.md's own callback
-- entry) there's no way to exercise real pausing here. Confirmed
-- directly, both through this binding and a bare C reproduction
-- outside Idris entirely, that calling it on a handle that either
-- hasn't started a transfer yet or has already finished one -- the
-- only two states reachable without a callback -- always returns
-- CURLE_BAD_FUNCTION_ARGUMENT (43): this is libcurl's own actual
-- behavior, not a binding bug. So this only confirms the binding
-- itself passes the right arguments through and gets the same result
-- C does, not that pausing itself works.
